# 👨🏻‍💻 My Website!

An Personal Website made with HTML and CSS that has my Accounts linked and a blog I can use to talk🗣️ about me and the site! and a media page📀! DM me on discord if you have media that you want on the media page
and make a issue if theres a bug!!

## 💾 Technologies!

- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `My brain`

## 🦄 Features!

Here's what you can do on My Website:

- **Media Pagea**: You can see media i added and other media people suggested.

- **Blog Page**: See what I'm doing with the site and me talking about my life!

- **The Index.html**: See my profiles and go to the other Pages

## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process!

I started by using AI for my first rendition of the website, but after a while, it kinda leaned on me. AI is not very good and using AI to do stuff. It's just enforcing people to use it. 
You see my website so I took matters into my own hands and made a sight with HTML and CSS because JavaScript is way too hard and it made it all by myself, with tutorials, VSCode and a GitHub repository to host it on github pages!

## 📚 What I Learned!

During this project, I've picked up basic HTML and CSS and a better understanding of web development, which improved my logical thinking.

## 💭 How can it be improved?

- Make the Index.html more important and not just a page opener for the media and blog page
- Add JS to it for more functionality and features.
- Add more Media to make it less bland.
- Add changeabe themes like Light mode, dark mode, and more.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open it in vscode.
3. Get Live server press the Go Live button at the bottom.
4. Your browser automatically open up and then you can go through the website and change the code if you'd like to how you want it to look like.
